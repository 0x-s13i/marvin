# Marvin

## *Marvin* is a library for integrating Large Language Model into your software. 
- It's a framework for perfectionists, a module for tinkerers, and a place to copy/paste for skeptics.
- It's delightfully opinionated at every layer you choose to use it. 
- It's customizable, ejectable, and most important fully open source.

### *Marvin* is ergonomics-first.
- We're obsessed with the accessibility, speed, reliability, and feel of building with LLMs. 
- We're building tools to let folks build at the speed of thought.
- We're looking for others who share our mission: join our Discord or open a PR. 

### If you know *Python*, you know *Marvin*. 
The last generation of software got a lot of things right. We're building the tools that let you use LLMs in `ambient mode` in the dialect you know best. 

### Quick Install
`pip install marvin`

### What you can build with Marvin in 5 minutes. We're serious, time it.
Our community is on a constant listening tour with developers, engineers, founders, and investors to surface the most valuable design patterns. We ship quickly, thoughtfully, and purposefully to enable others to build simply, quickly, and confidently.
