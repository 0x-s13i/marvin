## *Marvin* is a library for integrating Large Language Model into your software. 
- It's a lightweight framework for perfectionists, a module for tinkerers, and a place to copy/paste for purists.
- It's delightfully opinionated at every layer you choose to use it. 
- It's customizable, ejectable, and most important fully open source.

### *Marvin* is ergonomics-first.
- We're obsessed with the accessibility, speed, reliability, and feel of building with LLMs. 
- We've built Marvin with reusability and incremental adoption in mind:
    - Nothing wild or unexpected behind the scenes happening in service of a small task. 
    - Small footprint so you're not downloading the kitchen sink.
- We're looking for others who share our mission: join our Discord or open a PR. 

### If you know *Python*, you know *Marvin*. 
- If you want to use LLMs in `ambient mode` in the dialect you know best, use Marvin. 
- If you want to build a full-fledged application, use Marvin.
- If you want to use a utility without downloading the kitchen sink, use Marvin.

### Quick Install
`pip install marvin`

### What you can build with Marvin in 5 minutes. We're serious, time it.
Our community is on a constant listening tour with developers, engineers, founders, and investors to surface the most valuable design patterns. We ship quickly, thoughtfully, and purposefully to enable others to build simply, quickly, and confidently.
