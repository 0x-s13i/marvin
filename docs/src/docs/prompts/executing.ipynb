      "Yes, you are correct! In traditional Euclidean geometry, the angles of a triangle always add up to 180 degrees. However, there are indeed other types of geometries where this is not the case. One such example is non-Euclidean geometry, which includes hyperbolic and elliptic geometries. In hyperbolic geometry, the angles of a triangle add up to less than 180 degrees, while in elliptic geometry, the angles add up to more than 180 degrees. These non-Euclidean geometries have their own unique properties and are studied in mathematics and physics.\n"
