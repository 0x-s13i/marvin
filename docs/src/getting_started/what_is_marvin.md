# What is Marvin?
![](../../img/heroes/it_hates_me_hero.png)


Marvin is a lightweight framework for building AI-powered software. It's designed primarily for AI engineers: users who want to deploy cutting-edge AI to build powerful new features and applications.

Marvin is ergonomic and opinionated at every layer. Nonetheless, it’s incrementally adoptable and you can use it as much or as little as you like. It’s a Swiss Army Knife, not a kitchen sink. It’s familiar. It feels like the library you’d write if you had the time: simple, accessible, portable LLM abstractions that you can quickly deploy in your application, whether you’re doing straightforward NLP or building a full-featured autonomous agent.

With Marvin, we’re embarking on a journey to build Ambient AI: omnipresent but unobtrusive autonomous routines that act as persistent translators for noisy, real-world data. Ambient AI makes unstructured data universally accessible to traditional software, allowing the entire software stack to embrace AI technology without interrupting the development workflow. Marvin brings simplicity and stability to AI engineering through abstractions that are reliable and easy to trust.
