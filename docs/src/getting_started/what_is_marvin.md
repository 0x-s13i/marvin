# What is Marvin?
![](../../img/heroes/it_hates_me_hero.png)


Marvin is a lightweight framework for building AI-powered software that's reliable, scalable, and easy to trust. It's designed primarily for AI engineers: users who want to deploy cutting-edge AI to build powerful new features and applications.

Sometimes the most challenging part of working with AI is remembering that it's not magic; it's software. It's new, it's nondeterministic, and it's incredibly powerful, but it's still software: parameterized API calls that can trigger dependent actions (and just might talk like a pirate). Marvin's goal is to bring the best practices of building dependable, observable software to the frontier of generative AI. This objective is woven into our DNA: [Prefect](https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect) does the same for data engineers. 

That's why Marvin is focused on a rock-solid developer experience. It's ergonomic and opinionated at every layer, but also incrementally adoptable and you can use it as much or as little as you like. It‚Äôs a Swiss Army Knife, not a kitchen sink. It‚Äôs familiar. It feels like the library you‚Äôd write if you had the time: simple, accessible, portable LLM abstractions that you can quickly deploy in your application, whether you‚Äôre doing straightforward NLP or building a full-featured autonomous agent.

Marvin prioritizes a developer experience focused on speed and reliability. It's built with type-safety and observability as first-class citizens. Its abstractions are Pythonic, simple, and self-documenting. These core primitives let us build surprisingly complex agentic software without sacrificing control:

üß© **AI Models** for structuring text into type-safe schemas

üè∑Ô∏è **AI Classifiers** for bulletproof classification and routing

ü™Ñ **AI Functions** for complex business logic and transformations

ü§ù **AI Applications** for interactive use and persistent state

With Marvin, we‚Äôre embarking on a journey to build Ambient AI: omnipresent but unobtrusive autonomous routines that act as persistent translators for noisy, real-world data. Ambient AI makes unstructured data universally accessible to traditional software, allowing the entire software stack to embrace AI technology without interrupting the development workflow. Marvin brings simplicity and stability to AI engineering through abstractions that are reliable and easy to trust. 

Marvin's 1.0 release reflects our confidence that its core abstractions are locked-in. And why wouldn't they be? They're the same interfaces you use every day: Python functions, classes, enums, and Pydantic models. Our next objectives are leveraging these primitives to build production deployment patterns and an observability platform.
